## Overview
CITRA Dashboard is a web-based interface for monitoring event visitors' satisfaction through real-time data visualization. It's part of the CITRA application that uses camera feeds and 
facial recognition to gauge emotions at various events. The dashboard is designed to provide insights for both CITRA team members and event organizers.

##Quick start
Before setting up the CITRA Dashboard, ensure you have the following installed:
- Recommended Node.js v18.x.
- Install: yarn install
- Start: yarn dev
- Build: yarn build

  ## Note
  
 This project was created for the development and build process within a React environment. After building, the output must be integrated with the 
 main CITRA application's `public` directory (https://github.com/AhmedAlqarniGitHub/CITRA_db_dashboard). This ensures the React app is served correctly within the broader 
 application infrastructure. Adjust paths and details to align with the specifics of your project structure.
